This [lfcelite notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/terrydolan/lfcelite/blob/master/lfcelite.ipynb) analyses Liverpool Football Club's elite strikers data from 1962-1963 to 2014-2015. An elite striker is defined as a player who scored 20 or more league goals in a season. I've started the analysis at 1962 as this was when Bill Shankly returned Liverpool to the top flight of English football.

The analysis uses IPython Notebook, python, pandas and matplotlib to investigate the data from lfchistory.net. The  graphs are generated automatically from the munged data to help describe LFC's performance.
